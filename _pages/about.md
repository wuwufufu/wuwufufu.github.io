Hi! I’m **Haoran** 👋 — a sophomore studying Data Science at Renmin University of China 🎓.  
I like taking noisy data 📊 and ideas 💡, shrinking them until they fit on one page 📄, and then testing whether they actually say anything 🧠.

You can call me **wuwufufu**, **wufu**, or **5f (碔砆)** — that’s been my WeChat nickname for the past five or six years 📱.  
You can also call me **Theodore**, or **Ted** for short ✨, which has been my English name for over a decade.  
If you catch me staring at a plot 📈, I’m probably deciding whether it’s telling the truth 🔬 or just being pretty 🎨.

Hope to make tons of friends along the way 🤝！

## What I’m curious about (right now) 📚
- How **generative models** can help us reason 🧠, not just produce samples.  
- Where **causal inference** clarifies decisions—and where it quietly assumes too much 🔍.  
- How to design evaluations that don’t Goodhart themselves into nonsense 🎯.  
- Tiny, reproducible experiments 🧪 that beat gigantic, unrepeatable ones 🏗️.

## Working style (a few rules I try to keep) 📝
1. **Start embarrassingly small.** If it can’t fit in a notebook cell or a one-page memo, I don’t understand it yet 🐣.  
2. **Write the assumptions before the code.** If they’re wrong, at least I can delete a paragraph instead of a week ✍️.  
3. **Name things kindly.** Future-me is a teammate, not an enemy 🤗.  
4. **Draw the picture.** A DAG/TikZ sketch beats five paragraphs of prose 🖼️.  
5. **Ship notes, not just numbers.** A result without a one-sentence claim is just a screenshot 📮.

## Topics I like to talk about 💬
- Diffusion vs. flow matching (intuitions, not only equations) 🔬  
- Identifiability folklore in applied settings 🧩  
- When “more data” is actually **less information** 📉  
- Making figures that don’t lie 📊  
- Study setups, reading pipelines, and note systems that survive exams **and** research 📚

## A few personal quirks 😅
- I measure time in **pages written**, not hours 📖.  
- Coffee for reading ☕, tea for debugging 🍵.  
- Favorite keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl/Cmd + F** 🔎. If I can’t search it, I’ll forget it.  
- I like proofs with only one clever step—and I try to put it in the middle ✨.
